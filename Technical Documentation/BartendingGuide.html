        <p>Over a decade spent behind the bar has given me some knowledge that I would like to pass on to those just starting out.</p>
      <p>The hours can be a drag and dealing with intoxicated people is always a pain</p>
      <p>Your feet will hurt, you will be sticky more often than you would like to think and you're definitely not going to get rich</p>
      <p>But it has been an experience that I wouldn't trade for anything, even if I do hope that I have spent my last shift getting you heathens drunk</p>

    <p>There's no need to spend money to learn recipes that you can teach yourself. No matter how expensive or well equipped a bartending academy may be, there is still no substitute for relevant restaurant experience.</p>
    <p>If you know that bartending is what you want to do but have no experience, seek out a serving job at a busy restaurant.</p>
    <p>Restaurant bartending is usually less demanding and restaurants will often look to promote servers and train them into bartenders</p>
